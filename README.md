It is a single page web application driven by asyncrounous Javascript utilizing a backend Rails API (Backend repository here: https://github.com/mcrooks65/pantry-js-backend)

## Description
Pantry-js is an application designed to help track and organize the food in your pantry.  Current version is only a minimum viable product for the JavaScript project at Flatiron School, but other features could be implemented such as grocery-cart and recipe modules which would enhance the utility of the application greatly.

## Installation
